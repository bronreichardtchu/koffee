def log_rebin(lamRange, spec, oversample=1, velscale=None, flux=False):
    """
    Logarithmically rebin a spectrum, while rigorously conserving the flux.
    Basically the photons in the spectrum are simply redistributed according
    to a new grid of pixels, with non-uniform size in the spectral direction.

    When the flux keyword is set, this program performs an exact integration
    of the original spectrum, assumed to be a step function within the
    linearly-spaced pixels, onto the new logarithmically-spaced pixels.
    The output was tested to agree with the analytic solution.

    :param lamRange: two elements vector containing the central wavelength
        of the first and last pixels in the spectrum, which is assumed
        to have constant wavelength scale! E.g. from the values in the
        standard FITS keywords: LAMRANGE = CRVAL1 + [0, CDELT1*(NAXIS1 - 1)].
        It must be LAMRANGE[0] < LAMRANGE[1].
    :param spec: input spectrum.
    :param oversample: can be used, not to loose spectral resolution,
        especally for extended wavelength ranges and to avoid aliasing.
        Default: OVERSAMPLE=1 ==> Same number of output pixels as input.
    :param velscale: velocity scale in km/s per pixels. If this variable is
        not defined, then it will contain in output the velocity scale.
        If this variable is defined by the user it will be used
        to set the output number of pixels and wavelength scale.
    :param flux: (boolean) True to preserve total flux. In this case the
        log rebinning changes the pixels flux in proportion to their
        dLam so the following command will show large differences
        beween the spectral shape before and after LOG_REBIN:
           plt.plot(exp(logLam), specNew)  # Plot log-rebinned spectrum
           plt.plot(np.linspace(lamRange[0], lamRange[1], spec.size), spec)

        two spectra that almost perfectly overlap each other.

        logarithm of the wavelength and velscale is in km/s.

    Generally, these templates represent the instrumental line spread function
    (LSF) at the set of wavelengths of each emission line. In this case, pPXF
    will return the intrinsic (i.e. true) dispersion of the gas lines.

    Alternatively, one can input FWHM_gal=0, in which case pPXF will return a
    dispersion which includes both the intrumental and the intrinsic disperson.

    Additional lines can be easily added by editing the code of this procedure,
    which is meant as a template to be modified by the users where needed.

    For accuracy the Gaussians are integrated over the pixels boundaries.
    This can be changed by setting `pixel`=False.

        in Angstrom. One can pass either a scalar or the name "func" of a function
        func(wave) which returns the FWHM for a given vector of input wavelengths.

        flux_2) provided by pPXF for the two lines of the doublet, do *not*
        represent the actual fluxes of the two lines, but the fluxes of the two
        input *doublets* of which the fit is a linear combination.
        If the two doublets templates have line ratios rat_1 and rat_2, and
        pPXF prints fluxes flux_1 and flux_2, the actual ratio and flux of the

            ratio_total([SII]6716/6731) = (0.44*flux_1 + 1.43*flux_2)/flux_total
